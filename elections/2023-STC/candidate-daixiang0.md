#### Your work and/or contributions to Dapr

I actively contribute to the community, introduce WASM to Dapr, add [WASM HTTP middleware feature](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-middleware/middleware-wasm/), and work with contributors from Tetrate and other companies to Optimize and enrich usage scenarios of WASM in Dapr.

As a maintainer, I actively conduct code reviews and conscientiously perform my maintainer duties.

As a contributor in China, I take the initiative to communicate with Chinese users and developers to understand their opinions and expectations for Dapr, share these ideas with the community, and work with them to promote the establishment of the Dapr China Conference.

Also, I participate in various events and big conferences, such as KuebeCon, DaprCon, OpenInfra Days China, etc., to promote Dapr and recommend to attendees to try and use Dapr.

#### Why you are running

I love Dapr very much.


I hope to see more users and customers all over the world.
